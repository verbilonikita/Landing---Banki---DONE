# Basic Landing

Desided to practice old-school float way of CSS layout building, so no flex-box or grid on that.

Used most of the features e.g 
1. flip card 
2. form validation with red line if wrong and green if ok
3. Lots of different transitions.
4. Optimised for several browsers and phones/tablets.
